##### This is the journey of getting my OSCP certification.

There are many reviews available on the internet for reference so I am going to give quick review about my journey and mistakes that people should avoid while preparing.

I was newbie in Pentesting whan i decided to take this course so i started with basics.

##### 1.Linux and Windows Commands

##### 2.Networking Concepts and Tools

##### 3.Bash Scripting

##### 4.Web application attacks (SQLi, XSS, Local/Remote File Inclusion, Remote Code Execution)

##### 5.Metasploit

##### 6.Buffer Overflow

I started with books i mentioned earlier, they helped me to understand the penetration testing concepts and tools.Then i moved to rootme challanges, After solving few challanges i started with Vulhnub Machines.I used Walkthrough to solve first 20 machines to get the idea how exactly the process and tools help step by step to get the system access.

After that i started doing machines by myself and used walkthrough whenever i used to get stuck.Practice is the only way so don't get frustrated if you can't manage to solve machines in first few weeks by yourself.It took me around 2 months to solve those 20 machines with walkthrough.

After solving around 50 Vulhnub machines,I enrolled for PWK course with 60 days lab access.I tried to solve one or two machines per day.I booked my exam during my lab.

Before my first attempt i read reviews and planned things for the exam day.But things didn't go as planned.
I wasn't able to complete buffer overflow machine and didn't take sleep break and meals on time.The lesson i learned from my first exam attempt was to not get nervous and practice buffer overflow.

I Subscribed Hackthebox VIP to solve retired machines for practice and watched ippsec videos before my next attempt.I failed multiple exam attempts and learned lessons.After Every failed exam attempt i reviewd my strategy and tried to improve weak areas.

##### The lessons I learned from failures -
- Practice buffer overflow.
- Practice privilege escalation(Linux and Windows)
- Use script to scan machines(Autorecon)
- While enumeration Use checklist to avoid missing important details.
- Take notes.
- Take breaks after every 2-3 hours.
- Don’t spend too much time on one technique.
- Switch machines every two hours.
- There is only one chance to use metasploit,do it wisely.
- Always reset machine before you start solving.

I cleared my Exam last week.It was long journey for me.
I avoided all those mistakes i made in previous attempts and cleared exam by compromising 4 out of 5 Machines. 

I hope you might get some tips from this, and hopefully it helps some people out.
