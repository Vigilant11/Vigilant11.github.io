#### 1) Injection
In Injection attack,attacker can submit different types of input which gets interpreted and executed by the processor as a search query or command, generating wrong or unexpected results. The attacker can further attack the website to crash it or get any confidential data.

this attack can lead to data loss, denial of service, as well as full system compromise.

Different Injection Types : CRLF injection, XPATH injection, LDAP injection, SQL injection, HTML injection, code injection, Template injection etc.

##### SQL Injection
In this attack, attacker executes a malicious SQL statements that control application database server. 
SQL Injection can also be used to add, modify and delete records in a database.

Impacts of SQL Injections are Authentication Bypass, Information Disclosure, Data Loss, Denial of service and at times System Compromise.

##### Types of SQL Injection
1. In-band (Classic) SQLi - Using  same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results.
- Error-based SQLi - This technique relies on error messages thrown by the database to obtain hints about the DB structure. 
Attacker sends a malicious query to the database which results in errors.

- Union-based SQLi - This technique uses union command in SQL query to execute additional queries;like modify, insert or delete contents of the table.

2. Inferential(Blind) SQLi - This type of SQL injection attack relies on indirect clues in behavior of application. 
Details within HTTP responses, blank web pages for certain user input, and how long it takes the database to respond to certain user input.

- Boolean-based SQLi - In this type of attack, a Boolean query causes the application to give a different response for a valid or invalid result in the database. 

- Time-based SQLi - This type of attack involves the sending of a timed SQL query to the database. Based on the response time as well as the response itself, a hacker can assess if their payload is successfully sent. 
The main downside of this SQL injection type is its duration to carry out the process.

3. Out-of-Band SQLi - Out-of-band SQL injection techniques are dependent on the database server’s ability to make DNS or HTTP requests to deliver data to the hacker.

##### Mitigation
The main reason for injections to happen is the lack of validation and sanitation of data consumed by the application. 
In general,make sure that development team is following security requirements when writing code.

1) Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)
2) Utilize the principle of least privilege when provisioning accounts used to connect to the SQL database.
3) Whitelist Input Validation
4) Escaping All User Supplied Input
5) Use LIMIT and other SQL controls to prevent mass disclosure in case of an attack.
6) Don’t use dynamic SQL
7) Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for web applications that access databases
8) Use a web application security testing solution to routinely test web apps that interact with databases
9) Keep databases updated to the latest available patches

#### 2) Broken Authentication
Broken authentication is typically caused by poorly implemented authentication and session management functions. 

##### Common Risk Factors
- Predictable login credentials.
- User authentication credentials that are not protected when stored.
- Session IDs exposed in the URL (e.g., URL rewriting).
- Session IDs vulnerable to session fixation attacks.
- Session value that does not time out or get invalidated after logout.
- Session IDs that are not rotated after successful login.
- Passwords, session IDs, and other credentials sent over unencrypted connections.

##### Mitigation
1. Do not deploy any default credentials.
2. Store passwords using a modern one-way hash function.
3. Implement weak password checks against a list of the top 10000 worst passwords.
4. Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same messages for all outcomes.
5. Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent credential stuffing, brute force, and stolen credential attacks.
6. Log authentication failures and alert administrators when attacks are detected.
7. Limit the attempts for authenticating.
8. Secure your password storage.

#### 3) Sensitive Data Exposure
Sensitive data exposure occurs when an application exposes personal data.

Sensitive data exposure occurs as a result of inadequately protecting a database where information is stored. This might be a result of a multitude of things such as weak encryption, no encryption, software flaws.

The data can vary anything from passwords, session tokens, credit card data etc.

##### Mitigation
1. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements, or business needs.
2. Classify data processed, stored, or transmitted by an application.
3. Apply controls according to the classification.
4. Don’t store sensitive data unnecessarily.
5. Use PCI DSS compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
6. Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
7. Ensure up-to-date and strong standard algorithms, protocols, and keys are in place; use proper key management.
8. Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters.
9. Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
10. Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data.
11. Ensure that stored passwords have a strong adaptive algorithm such as Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2.

#### 4) XML External Entities (XEE)
XML attack happens when an application that parsers XML input is attacked.

The attack can occur when XML input contains a reference to an external entity and when the reference is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. Such an attack may lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, DOS attack, server-side request forgery.

##### Resources
[External Entity Injection (XXE) \| AppCheck](https://appcheck-ng.com/external-entity-injection-xxe/)

##### Mitigation
1. Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.
2. Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher.
3. Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML parsers in the application, as per the OWASP Cheat Sheet 'XXE Prevention'.
4. Implement positive ("whitelisting") server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes.
5. Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates incoming XML using XSD validation or similar.
6. SAST tools can help detect XXE in source code, although manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex applications with many integrations.

#### 5) Broken Access Control
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot access or act with intended resources or permission.
Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user.

Sensitive data should be accessed by only authorized and permitted user.

- There are two categories of access control Vulnerabilities
1) Horizontal Privilege Escalation: Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data of another user with the same level of permissions.
Example - one user is able to perform action of another user without authorization.
3) Vertical Privilege Escalation: Occurs when a user can perform an action or access data that requires a level of access beyond their role.
Example - one user is able to perform action of admin without authorization.

##### Mitigation
1. With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
2. Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage.
3. Model access controls should enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record. 
4. Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
5. Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
6. Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures). 
7. Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
8. JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.
9. Developers and QA staff should include functional access control units and integration tests.

#### 6) Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfigurations are security settings inappropriately configured or left insecure that put your systems and data at risk. Basically, any poorly documented configuration changes, default settings, or a technical issue across any component in your endpoints could lead to a misconfiguration.


##### Mitigation
1. A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. Automate this process in order to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment.
2. A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.
3. A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management process. In particular, review cloud storage permissions.
4. A segmented application architecture that provides effective and secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups.
5. Sending security directives to clients, e.g. Security Headers.
6. An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.

#### 7) Cross-Site Scripting
XSS is an attack to inject malicious script to manipulate web appication which can be executed every time the page is loaded.

The script can be designed to carry out a various malicious acts, leaving the user vulnerable to potential cookie, credential, data, or identity theft; account takeover.
 

##### Types of XSS - 
1. Stored XSS (Persistent or Type I) - This attack occurs when a malicious script is being saved on the web server permanently.

2. Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent or Type II) - This attack occurs, when a malicious script is not being saved on the web server but reflected in the website’s results.

3. DOM Based XSS (Type-0) - This XSS attack type target the server side, but with DOM-based attacks, the script is fully on the client side and manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) instead of the HTML code. 
The attack payload modifies the DOM environment in the victim’s browser, causing the client-side code to be interpreted based on the hacker’s intent.

[What is cross-site scripting (XSS) and how to prevent it? \| Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)

##### Mitigation
1. Whitelist Values
2. Avoid and Restrict HTML in inputs
3. Sanitize Values
4. Encoding or Escape untrusted input.
5. Use HTTPOnly Flags on Cookies
6. Use a WAF to Protect against Cross-Site Scripting Attacks


#### 8) Insecure Deserialization
- The process of serialization is converting objects to byte strings.
- The process of deserialization is converting byte strings to objects.
Insecure deserialization can allow deserialized data to be modified to include malicious code that will likely damage the application if the data source is not verified.

##### Mitigation
1. Implementing integrity checks such as digital signatures on any serialized objects to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.
2. Logging deserialization exceptions and failures, such as where the incoming type is not the expected type, or the deserialization throws exceptions.
3. Restricting or monitoring incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize.
4. Monitoring deserialization, alerting if a user deserializes constantly.
5. Encrypting serialization processes.
6. Not accepting serialized objects from unknown or untrusted sources.
7. Running the deserialization code with limited access permissions.
8. Using a firewall which can help detect insecure deserialization.

#### 9) Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
When vulnerabilities are known, in most cases, vendors can fix them right way and release a patch or update.
To maximize security in your application, it is highly recommended that every development team have at least one person responsible for tracking, patching and for making sure the components are free of vulnerabilities.

##### Mitigation
1. Remove all unnecessary dependencies.
2. Have an inventory of all your components on the client-side and server-side.
3. Monitor sources like Common Vulnerabilities and Disclosures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for vulnerabilities in the components.
4. Obtain components only from official sources.
5. Get rid of components not actively maintained.
6. Use Web Application Firewall.

#### 10) Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
This includes keeping your website monitored on a regular basis so you can take immediate action when something happens.
Not having an efficient logging and monitoring process in place can increase the damage of a website compromise.

##### Mitigation
1. All login, access control, and server-side input validation errors should be logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts. Logs should be retained for a period of time that allows delayed forensic analysis.
2. Ensure that logs are created in a format that can be easily used by central log management tools.
3. High-value transactions should have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent manipulation or deletion.
4. Effective monitoring and alerting should be established so that suspicious activities can be detected and responded to in a timely manner.
5. A separate and dedicated, security hardened server platform to capture and store events in the audit log.
6. The use of network time synchronization technology to synchronize system clocks. This also enables automated monitoring tools to analyze event patterns that occur in real time.
7. Strong access control to logs.
8. The creation of a formal incident response plan.
9. Ensuring 24/7 monitoring by implementing a warning system for monitoring personnel.
